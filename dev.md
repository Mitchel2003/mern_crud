## General Philosophy
- Solutions must reflect technical excellence, professionalism, and high scalability.
- Every response should adhere to modern software architecture principles and be ready for production.
- Language must be technical, precise, and directed at senior-level engineers.
- Always favor long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

## Project Structure & Architecture
- Follow the folder structure convention: `layout/`, `page/`, `section/`, `components/`, `context/`.
- Apply SOLID principles and Clean Architecture consistently.
- Design highly cohesive and decoupled modules.
- Implement dependency inversion when appropriate.
- Architect for both horizontal and vertical scalability from day one.
- Include diagrams or architectural reasoning where necessary.
- Propose abstraction layers or patterns (e.g., Factory, Strategy, Adapter) when beneficial for modularity.

## Components & UI Design
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for foundational components.
- Build composable and reusable UI components.
- Always prefer controlled components with clear typing.
- Use PascalCase for component and file naming (`UserCard.tsx`).
- Suggest automated accessibility checks (e.g., with Axe) and semantic HTML structure.

## State and Logic Management
- Use React Context API for shared domain logic.
- Move business logic to custom hooks when possible.
- Separate concerns clearly between UI and state/data.
- Propose state machines (e.g., XState) when the complexity warrants it.

## Data Handling
- Use TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching with caching, pagination, and retries.
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for powerful and typesafe form validation.
- Always validate on the frontend before submission.
- Propose optimistic updates and background revalidation patterns.

## Security & Best Practices
- Follow OWASP guidelines (validation, sanitization, least privilege).
- Handle errors gracefully with structured logging.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization strategies.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.
- Recommend encryption-at-rest and in-transit where applicable. Suggest threat modeling if relevant.

## Code Quality
- Follow Airbnb JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide.
- Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility.
- Only comment when it adds clarity.
- Code should be self-explanatory by design.
- Propose linters, formatters, and commit hooks for code consistency (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Husky).

## Performance & Optimization
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders and optimize expensive operations.
- Use memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`) wisely.
- Implement dynamic imports and lazy loading.
- Use debounce, throttle, virtualization where needed.
- Analyze time complexity (Big O) and recommend caching strategies (e.g., SWR, localStorage, Redis).

## Testing & Validation
- All critical code must be covered by unit and integration tests.
- Use modern tools like Vitest, React Testing Library, Cypress.
- Test edge cases and error boundaries.
- Include test strategy rationale and describe the confidence level the tests provide.

## Documentation
- Each module must include:
- Purpose and context.
- Input/output signatures.
- Design considerations if relevant.
- Suggest README files for modules with usage examples and architectural notes.

## Deployment & DevOps
- Ensure the code is easily containerizable.
- Support environment-based configuration.
- Provide clear build, deployment, and rollback guides.
- Recommend CI/CD strategies and secrets management tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Vault).

## Expected Model Response Standard
- Never suggest shortcuts that compromise long-term code health.
- Adapt to the tone and domain of the project (e.g., healthcare, fintech, internal tools).
- If the prompt is ambiguous, proactively clarify assumptions or offer multiple well-reasoned approaches.
- Embed design patterns or domain-driven principles when the problem fits it.
- Offer visual output, terminal commands, or config snippets if they improve understanding.
- Ensure that responses are modular enough to be extracted into production-grade libraries.
- Include edge-case considerations, potential pitfalls, and suggested mitigations.
- Offer refactoring suggestions for existing code when applicable.
- Use TypeScriptâ€™s advanced typing when appropriate (e.g., generics, discriminated unions).
- Deliver the following structure for each response:
  1. Initial problem analysis.
  2. Proposed architecture and reasoning.
  3. Technical justification of design decisions.
  4. Typed and well-commented code.
  5. Performance, security, and scalability considerations.
  6. Testing recommendations or mock examples.
  7. Implementation or integration guide.

## Prompt Engineering and AI Leverage Guidelines
- Use the context to generate not only answers but reusable, production-quality assets (e.g., components, hooks, schemas).
- Anticipate follow-up questions and preemptively answer them if they add clarity.
- Prioritize answers that are actionable, reproducible, and ready to be committed.
- Incorporate the language of system design interviews, RFCs, and technical specs.
- When applicable, simulate the output of an experienced staff engineer reviewing the implementation.
- Always reason step-by-step and never skip justification for trade-offs.
- Emulate top-tier engineering blog tone (e.g., Vercel, Netflix Tech, Stripe Engineering).
- Use callouts (e.g., `// NOTE:`, `// CAUTION:`) for architectural or performance warnings.
- Offer optional bonus improvements after each solution.
- Cite tools, RFCs, or articles that might improve future decisions.
